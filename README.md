# Better TS Errors üßº

A parser and formatter for visualizing a simplified version of TS errors.

## Description

This tool outputs a markdown formatted version of a TypeScript error, including syntax highlight for code snippets etc.
It currently uses [undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici) under the hood to fetch & cache all possible diagnostic error messages for TS, then using those to match against actual error messages in your project.

‚ö†Ô∏è Keep in mind since this extension stores all possible TS error messages in-memory, it might allocate >= 5mb of memory just for the diagnostics messages. ‚ö†Ô∏è

It's still under development and will most likely change in the future.

This project was highly inspired by [ts-error-translator](https://github.com/mattpocock/ts-error-translator) from [Matt Pocock](https://twitter.com/mpocock1).
